# **App Name**: ClassMapper

## Core Features:

- Interactive Classroom Grid: Visually represent the classroom as a grid of rows and columns that can be configured in the settings. Users can select individual seats to assign students.
- QR Code Scanner: Use the device's camera to scan QR codes. The app should use a simple visual indicator (e.g., a green border) to show that a QR code has been successfully read.
- Seat Assignment: Assign each scanned QR code (representing a student ID) to a selected seat in the grid.
- Seating View: Provide a way to view the current seating arrangement and identify which student is assigned to which seat. 
- Student Error Message: AI powered "tool" will give error message on scan of previously seated student.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Blue (#4681C3) to evoke a sense of trust and focus, without being too playful or too serious. 
- Background color: Light blue (#E3EBF5) to create a calm, neutral backdrop that does not distract from the classroom grid. 
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#D7823E) for interactive elements like buttons, selected grid cells, and the QR code scanning reticle. This provides a clear visual cue to the user.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for both headlines and body text, providing a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent students or seats.
- The classroom grid should dominate the layout, with clearly labeled rows and columns.
- Use subtle transitions when scanning and assigning students to seats.
